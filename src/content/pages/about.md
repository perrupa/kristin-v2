Thank you for taking the time to visit my site. Hopefully I can provide you with some valuable insight to all things fitness and nutrition, including some yummy recipes!

My ultimate vision for this site is to offer visitors an opportunity to find nutritious and delicious “primarily plant based” recipes, food, as well as fitness tips and tricks for sustainable success in your health and wellness journey. Eventually, my goal is to provide online guides and personal training/nutrition coaching to clients virtually or in person (if local).

I am currently completing my Precision Nutrition Level 1 certification, and I have been certified as a Personal Trainer since 2018 with CPTN (Certified Professional Training Network).

I have been primarily plant based now for almost 3 years, 2 of which I was 100% plant based. I decided about 6 months ago to re-introduce eggs, fish, and shellfish back into my diet.

So, in regard to the recipes you will see here, they are “primarily plant based” with an occasional added twist with eggs or the occasional fish dish. I will always post plant based versions of ingredients, with the option to make the recipe non-plant based in some cases.


❤️  Kristin
